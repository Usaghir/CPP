 Description : This program will reduce the fraction to lower terms.
 
 Reducing Fractions to Lowest Terms
 
 Issue
 
 Write a program that asks the user to enter the values of a fraction. A
 structure, with data members that can represent the numerator and the
 denominator, shall be used to store the fraction. Moreover, the program should
 satisfy the following requirements.
 1. The program should reduce the fraction to its lowest terms and print the
 lowest terms as shown in the example output displayed below as a test case.
 2. After reducing the fraction to lowest terms, the program should represent
 (print) the fraction in mixed form, that is, for example, 3/2 = 1Â½,
 or 25/7 = 3 4/7
 3. It is not common to use a negative denominator (eg: 4/-3). In such cases,
 the fraction should be adjusted so that denominator instead becomes positive
 and the numerator switches sign (eg: -4/3).
 4. Multiple calculations should be able to perform without restarting the
 application.
