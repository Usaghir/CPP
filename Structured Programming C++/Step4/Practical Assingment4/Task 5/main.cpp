 Description : This program will calculate the height of child by the height of
 the parents.
 
 Heights
 
 One way to estimate the height of a child is to use the following formula,
 which uses the height of the parents:
 
 Hmale_child = ((Hmother 13/12) + Hfather) / 2
 
 Hfemale_child = ((Hfather 12/13) + Hmother) / 2
 
 Write a function that takes as input parameters the gender of the child,
 height of the mother in inches, and height of the father in
 inches, and outputs the estimated height of the child in inches. Embed
 your function in a program that allows you to test the function
 over and over again until telling the program to exit.
 
 The user should be able to input the heights in feet and inches, and the
 program should output the estimated height of the child in
 feet and inches. Use the integer data type to store the heights.
